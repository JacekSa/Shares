 
 After reading the requirements the following assumptions were made :
 
 -User needs to be able to insert a price . A console based output will be provided .
 -Each time a user inserts a data for a stock (price,symbol) it is a sale/buy action
 and the sale/buy indicator must be provided .
 
 -user must control the end and a start of each transaction . Each transaction has some
 traded stocks in it (bought or sold) . 
 
  1 . I have developed a test which will check if a proper transaction object structure is created .
  2 . I have developed a test which will check if stocks objects are created correctly  .
