 
 After reading the requirements the following assumptions were made :
 
 - User needs to be able to insert a price . A console based output will be provided .
 - Each time a user inserts a data for a stock (price,symbol) it is a sale/buy action .
 and the sale/buy indicator must be provided .
 
 - User must control the end and a start of each transaction . Each transaction has some
 traded stocks in it (bought or sold) . 
 
 - The stocks are persisted in an xml file for validation and the additional data storage .
 
 workflow : 
 
 -  I have developed a test which will check if a proper transaction object structure is created .
  
 -  I have developed a test which will check if stocks objects are created correctly  .  
 
 -  Input logic was created .
